## Overview
Scripts and data tables within this repository are for Step 2 of the [UCSRB Habitat Prioritization process](https://www.ucsrb.org/prioritization/). I will endeavor to update the data available on this page, however the most up-to-date results for Step 2 can be found on the [Prioritization Products Page](https://www.ucsrb.org/prioritization-products/).

## Reach and Action Prioritization
The RTT decided to use three pathways to develop prioritized reaches and actions: Habitat Quality pathway, Limiting Factors pathway, and fish passage pathway.  This python tool deals primarily with the Habitat Quality and Limiting Factors pathway.  The filters and criteria for filters (as of October 14th, 2020) are overviewd in this [google slides presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1dEJ-A_LlW1HkxfIjOfLmjRxS1DRR_nWGOsBlZj5khss/edit?usp=sharing). 

## Python Scripts
This python code is written with jupyter ipython notebooks, which make the code easier to understand and track.  For an overview how to install python and Anaconda (required for jupyter noteboks), [this page](https://www.codecademy.com/articles/how-to-use-ipython) overviews the process.
